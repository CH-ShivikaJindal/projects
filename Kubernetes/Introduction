Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers.

a. Lets you schedule containers on a cluster of machines.
b. You can run multiple containers on one machine.
c. You can run long running services (like web applications).
d. Kubernetes will manage the state of these containers.

   1. Can start on a specific node.
   2. Will restart a container when it gets killed.
   3. Can move containers from one node to the another node.

Instead of running a few docker containers on one host manually,
Kubernetes is a platform that will manage the containers for you.

Some other popular docker orchestrators are:
1. Docker Swarm (isn't as extensive as Kubernetes)
2. Mesos

   1. On-premises (own datacenter)
   2. Public (Google cloud, AWS)
   3. hybrid; public and private

b. Highly modular (You can make changes when necessary)
c. Open source
d. Great community
e. Backed by Google
