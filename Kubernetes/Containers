Virtual Machine vs Containers

Virtual Machine consists of:
1. Server.
2. Physical Machine
3. Host OS
4. Hypervisor (manage guest OS to have multiple OS on one host)
5. Guest OS
6. binaries and libraries
7. app A, app B, app C

Virtual machine with multiple guest OS is usually pretty
heavy, with each OS having its own libraries and binaries,
and also takes time to boot up. It needs to go through the
whole boot cycle for OS to be up and running.

On the contrary, Containers have the following:
1. Physical Server
2. Host OS
3. Docker Engine (bins, libs) allows to have multiple
containers.
4. app A, app B, app C

Advantage: Launching containers does not require whole Guest
OS to boot up and wouldn't take minutes to load.

About Docker:

Docker is the most popular container software.
It is an alternative to rocket (rkt) - which also
works with Kubernetes.

Docker Engine, it is a docker runtime; a software to
make build/run docker images.

Docker Hub: online service to store and fetch docker
images. Allows you to build docker images online. This
helps in building docker images on hub instead of on PC.

Docker benefits:
1. Isolation: you can ship a binary with all the dependencies.
2. Closer parity between dev, QA and production environment.
3. Docker makes development teams able to ship images faster.
4. You can run same docker mage, unchanged, on laptops,
data center, VMs, and cloud providers.
