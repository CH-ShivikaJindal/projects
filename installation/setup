# Setup virtual enviornment now
# Virtual environments let you have an isolated space on your server for Python projects, ensuring that 
# each of your projects can have its own set of dependencies that wonâ€™t disrupt any of your other project
# The process begins with installing venv module, part of standard Python library.

sudo apt-get install python3-venv

# Make sirectory where you want to create your environment. For instance:

mkdir environment
cd environment/

# Once you are in the directory, create virtual environment by running following command: 

pyvenv virtenv

# pyvenv sets up a new directory that contains a few items which we can view with the ls command, having files such as bin, include, lib, lib64, pyvenv.cfg, share.
