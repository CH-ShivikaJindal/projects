# Install python3-pip:

sudo apt-get update
python3 --version
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# Can upgrade python3-pip version, if prompted:

sudo apt-get upgrade python3-pip

# Test for successfull installation of a package. 

pip3 install numpy

# Install other packages and development tool for a robust programming environment.

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev

# Setup virtual enviornment now
# Virtual environments let you have an isolated space on your server for Python projects, ensuring that 
# each of your projects can have its own set of dependencies that wonâ€™t disrupt any of your other project
# The process begins with installing venv module, part of standard Python library.

sudo apt-get install python3-venv

# Make sirectory where you want to create your environment. For instance:

mkdir environment
cd environment/

# Once you are in the directory, create virtual environment by running following command: 

pyvenv virtenv

# pyvenv sets up a new directory that contains a few items which we can view with the ls command, having files such as bin, include, lib, lib64, pyvenv.cfg, share.

#For MAC OS:

#Check for pip package on your system
1. pip --version

2. sudo easy_install pip or pip install --upgrade pip (if you don't have it)

#Test your installation
3. pip install numpy 
 
#TIP: pip search <module_name>, will show you all the related packages.
4. pip install virtualenv

5. cd <directory where you have your project>

#You are now setting up a virtual environment for the project.
#This will also create a subdirectory named "venv".
#You can choose whatever meaningful name your want.
6. virtualenv venv

#Activate your vritual environment now. 
7. source venv/bin/activate

#Requirements file lets you pin down packages with/without versions, you want your 
#environment to have installed before running your script. 
8. vim requirements.txt 

#Strongly recommended to run the requirement.txt file before running your script.
#Be mindful of the name of the file. 
9. pip install -r requirements.txt

#You can/should deactivate your virtual enviorment when done.
#Be mindful of the name of the file. 
10. deactivate
