Notes: 

service handler: special type of task that handles the execution of a service/command based on a condition being met.

Here newly installed mod_wsgi to take place in effect, needs apache2 to be restarted. If the module is already running, apache2 needn't be restarted.

Therefore, "notify" will run "handler" only when there is any change to mod_wsi, it being a restart of mod_wsgi or installation.
