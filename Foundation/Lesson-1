Ansible Documentation

List all hosts in a file:  ansible -i hosts --limit-hosts all
Global ansible config file: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

You can create a local ansible.cfg file with default values in it.
This would let you list all hosts in the inventory without having to specify it everytime, while running ansible command. This is one such 
example of using local config file.
